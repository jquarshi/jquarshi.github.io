Greetings! ðŸ‘‹

I am a current Master's student for Mechanical Engineering at the [University of the Pacific](https://www.pacific.edu/), holding a bachelors in Civil Engineering from the same institution. 

Throughout my career I have explored various different paths to find out what field is right for me. After years of turmoil, I have found the light at the end of the tunnel - Materials Science.

- Research and Development
- Procedure development
- Machine Learning and Robotics
- Computational Complexity and Intelligence

My current goal is to further research in Materials Science in structural materials, allowing me to take my diverse background with me rather than leave it behind. I am aiming to provide research that will help move along the research in fusion.
