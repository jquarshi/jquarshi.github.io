I have joined the Explosives Materials Division @ [Sandia National Laboratories](https://www.sandia.gov/) as a Graduate Intern working under [Stewart Youngblood](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shyoungblood?original_referer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F) and [Daniel Bufford](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dbufford?original_referer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F). I look forward to doing great work under their supervision!
